The number of calories people should eat each day depends on several factors , including their age , size , height , sex , lifestyle , and overall general health . A physically active 6ft 2in male , aged 22 years , requires considerably more calories than a 5ft 2ins sedentary woman in her 70s .

Recommended daily calorie intakes also vary across the world . According to the National Health Service ( NHS  ) , UK , the average male adult needs approximately 2 ,500 calories per day to keep his weight constant , while the average adult female needs 2 ,000 . US authorities recommend 2700 calories per day for men and 2200 for women . It is interesting that in the UK , where people on average are taller than Americans , the recommended daily intake of calories is lower . Rates of overweight and obesity among both adults and children in the USA are considerably 
higher than in the United Kingdom .

The NHS stresses that rather than precisely counting numbers ( calories ), people should focus more on eating a healthy and well balanced diet , being physically active , and roughly balancing how many calories are consumed with the numbers burnt off each day .

According to the United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organization (  FAO  ), the average person's minimum calorie requirement per day globally is approximately 1800 kilocalories .
Daily calorie consumption varies considerably around the world ( countries in gray indicates no data available )
What is the difference between calories and kilocalories ?

Scientifically speaking , one kilocalorie is 1000 calories . However , the term calorie in lay English has become so loosely used with the same meaning as kilocalorie , that the two terms have virtually merged . In other words , in most cases , a calorie and kilocalorie have the same meaning .

A kilocalorie is the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of 1 kilogram of water from 15° to 16° Celsius ( centigrade ) at one atmosphere .

A  " small calorie "  refers to the traditional scientific term of calorie , meaning one-thousandth of a kilocalorie .

Internationally , most nations talk about food energy in kJ ( kilojoules ). 1 kcal ( kilocalorie ) = 4.184 kJ .

In this article , the term  " calorie "  means the same as  "  kilocalorie  "  or  "  kcal ".
Portion sizes

In industrialized nations and a growing number of emerging economies , people are consuming many more calories than they used to . Portion sizes in restaurants , both fast food ones as well as elegant places , are far greater today .
