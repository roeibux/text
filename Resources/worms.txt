The term worm ( pronounced /?w?rm/ ) refers to an obsolete taxon ( vermes ) used by Carolus Linnaeus and Jean - Baptiste Lamarck for all 
non - arthropod invertebrate animals , and stems from the Old English word wyrm . Currently it is used to describe many different distantly 
related animals that typically have a long cylindrical tube - like body and no legs . Most animals called  " worms "  are invertebrates , but the 
term is also used for the amphibian caecilians and the slow worm Anguis , a legless burrowing lizard . Invertebrate animals commonly called 
 " worms "  include annelids ( earthworms ) , nematodes ( roundworms ) , platyhelminthes ( flatworms ) , marine polychaete worms ( bristle worms ) , 
marine nemertean worms (  " bootlace worms "  ) , marine Chaetognatha ( arrow worms ) , priapulid worms , and insect larvae such as caterpillars , 
grubs , and maggots . Historical English - speaking cultures have used the ( now deprecated ) terms worm , Wurm , or wyrm to describe carnivorous 
reptiles (  " serpents "  ) , and the related mythical beasts dragons . The term worm can also be used as an insult or pejorative term used towards 
people to describe a cowardly or weak individual or individual seen as pitiable .

Worms vary in size from microscopic to over 1 metre ( 3 .3 ft ) in length for marine polychaete worms ( bristle worms ) , 6 .7 metres ( 22 ft ) for 
the African giant earthworm , Microchaetus , and 55 metres ( 180 ft ) for the marine nemertean worm ( bootlace worm ) , Lineus longissimus .

Various types of worm occupy a small variety of parasitic niches , living inside the bodies of other animals . Free - living worm species may live 
on land , in marine or freshwater environments , or burrow .

Worms live in almost all parts of the world including marine , freshwater , and terrestrial habitats . Some worms living in the ground help 
to condition the soil (  annelids , aschelminths ) . Many thrive as parasites of plants (  aschelminths ) and animals , including humans 
(  platyhelminths , aschelminths ) . Several other worms may be free - living , or nonparasitic . There are worms that live in freshwater , 
seawater , and even on the seashore . Ecologically , worms form an important link in the food chains in virtually all the ecosystems of the world .

Some species of earthworms have a tongue - like lobe above the mouth called prostomium . The prostomium is actually a sensory device . Earthworms do
not have a nose , eyes , ears , or hands to gather sensory information about their environment . Instead , they depend on their prostomium and 
sensory receptors in their skin to  " feel "  their way through the soil . Worms usually have a cylindrical , flattened , or leaf - like body shape 
and are often without any true limbs or appendages . Instead , they may have bristles or fins that help them move . A few have light - sensing 
organs . Worms vary in size from less than 1 mm ( 0 .04 inch ) in certain aschelminths to more than 30 m ( 100 feet ) in certain ribbon worms .

Some worms reproduce sexually . Hermaphroditism , the condition in which a single individual possesses both male and female reproductive parts , 
is common in many groups of worms . Asexual reproduction , whereby new individuals develop from the body cells of another , also occurs in some 
worms .

Worm species differ in their abilities to move about on their own . Many species have bodies with no major muscles , and cannot move on their 
own—they must be moved by forces or other animals in their environment . Many other species have bodies with major muscles and can move on 
their own; they are a type of muscular hydrostat . Many species of worms are decomposers; they break down dead plants and animals to return 
nutrients to the soil . They have also been known to infiltrate households feeding on food in the early stages of its decomposition namely 
breads and cheeses .

Some bugs are good for our health , and a pig parasite called the whipworm appears to be one of them .

Whipworm eggs have been found in human studies to reduce symptoms in a host of diseases that affect the immune system . Researchers at 
several universities have shown promising results in small numbers of patients with multiple sclerosis , Crohn's disease and ulcerative 
colitis . Biotechnology companies are conducting large clinical trials of the treatment . Other studies targeting rheumatoid arthritis , 
autism and some allergies are expected to begin this year .

Earthworms split into three different categories . The first are the surface dwellers , the Epigeic worms . Then there are the upper soil worms , 
the Endogeic worms . Finally ,there are the deep burrowing species , the Anecic .

Scientists have been trying to figure out why diseases that affect the immune system have increased dramatically over the past several decades 
in much of the developed world . For example , the incidence of asthma in U .S . children under 17 was up 28% in 2009 from 1999 , according to 
government data .

The whipworm treatment was born from a theory known as the hygiene hypothesis , which essentially says our environment has become too clean . 
Humans aren't exposed to microorganisms in the environment as much as they used to be , when more people farmed or lived closely with animals .

While many diseases have diminished thanks to improved hygiene and medicine , people aren't exposed to bacteria that helped regulate the 
immune system , the theory goes . This lack of exposure may , in part , be responsible for the increase in diseases in which the body's immune 
system goes awry .

Based on this hygiene hypothesis , researchers at the University of Iowa wanted to find a safe parasite—one that wasn't known to cause 
infection or illness in humans—for therapeutic purposes . This type of treatment is known as helminthic treatment , or more specifically TSO , 
from the Latin name for whipworm eggs : Trichuris Suis Ova .

 " It looks like the helminth [the parasite] rebalances the immune system , "  says Bobby Sandage , chief executive of Burlington , Mass . - based 
Coronado Biosciences , which is finishing up an early - stage clinical trial of whipworm to treat Crohn's disease . A Phase 2 trial is planned 
for this year .

In many autoimmune diseases , immune cells known as T1 cell cytokines proliferate and fight against the body's cells , the way they do when the 
body detects foreign invaders .
The introduction of the whipworm appears to spur the body to produce more of a different type of helpful immune cell—T2 helper cytokines—as a defense against the worms . This separate immune response appears to help counter the inflammatory response from diseases , say researchers .

This approach differs from many available treatments on the market for inflammatory diseases . If these drugs , which tend to suppress the immune system , are given in doses that are too high , the immune system can be compromised , says Robert Summers , a professor in gastroenterology and hepatology at the University of Iowa who helped run the trials .

TSO treatment is likely to be much less hazardous because it doesn't directly attack the body's immune system , says Dr . Summers .

When it comes to using bugs as treatment , one key , of course , is finding ones that won't sicken people .

Whipworm from pigs appeared to be a good candidate because they don't naturally infect humans and can't reproduce in them . Once the eggs 
are ingested , they pass through the stomach to the intestine . There , the worms hatch and latch on , and apparently prompt the modulating 
effect in the immune system . After about two weeks , they die and are absorbed or excreted .

Dr . Summers and his colleagues demonstrated encouraging findings in two studies published in 2005 . One examined 29 patients with Crohn's 
disease and found that after six months , 21 were considered remitted . ( There wasn't a control group for comparison . ) The other was study of 
54 patients with ulcerative colitis . Patients who received TSO treatment improved significantly more than those who got placebo .

Another area of interest for TSO researchers is in multiple sclerosis , with two small studies published last year . One of these , published in 
the Multiple Sclerosis Journal , showed brain lesions decreased in four of five patients three months into treatment , and rebounded two months after it ended .

Some researchers say the therapy could hold promise for autism as well .

Eric Hollander , director of the Autism and Obsessive - Compulsive Spectrum Program at Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein School of 
Medicine in the Bronx , N .Y . , 
expects to begin recruiting for a human trial in adults with autism by the end of March .

 " People are just beginning to think about modifying the immune inflammatory response to see if it has some sort of effect on behavioral 
symptoms , "  says Dr . Hollander .

In 2005 , Stewart Johnson , a portfolio manager at an insurance company in New York , and his wife were at their  " absolute limit "  with 
their then 14 - year - old autistic son . Mr . Johnson says he exhibited extremely disruptive behaviors , and agitation . The Johnsons were close 
to putting their son in a residential facility .

Around this time their son made his yearly trip to summer camp—always a difficult time .

But one day , says Mr . Johnson , a camp counselor called , saying his son was calm and behaving better than he had ever seen . The night after 
Mr . Johnson picked up his son—finding he was indeed well - behaved—he saw his son's legs were covered with many bites from chiggers , the larvae 
of mites . After about 10 days , the disruptive behaviors returned .  " I said , 'this can't be coincidence ,' "  says Mr . Johnson .

He started doing research , heard theories that the immune system may play a role in autism , and came across the work on whipworm eggs and 
Crohn's disease . He was able to obtain a supply to test on his son , though first he took the ova himself to make sure they were safe . 
The eggs , which aren't yet available in the U .S . , cost €300 ( $396 ) for a two - week vial , Mr . Johnson says .

After a reduced dosage of the invisible , tasteless eggs failed to help , Mr . Johnson consulted with the supplier , OvaMed GmbH , of Barsb?ttel , 
Germany , and bumped up the dosage . In about 10 weeks , the disruptive behaviors ceased .

The younger Mr . Johnson , who declined to comment , lives at home and has been taking the eggs ever since . The worst symptoms don't return so 
long as he stays on the treatment , Mr . Johnson says .
